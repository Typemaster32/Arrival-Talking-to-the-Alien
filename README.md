# Arrival-Talking-to-the-Alien-
This is my final project for 2023 ITP Winter Show, a generative artwork, a recreation of movie "Arrival". Here users can talk to the alien behind the screen like what they do in the movie. AI translation is accompanied.

To deploy in your machine, here is what you need to prepare:

1. OpenAI API KEY.
  Here's their homepage: https://openai.com/blog/openai-api
  Here's a good tutotial if you don't know where to start: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nafDyRsVnXU
  Tips: you'll need a payment method for OpenAI to use that. Each 100 reply costs about 3 cents. 1 dollar would be defenately enough.
2. IDE (VSCode Recommended) https://code.visualstudio.com/
3. In VSCode extension, find "Live Server" and add it.
4. If you don't plan to use VSCode or Live Server, pay attention to the "Go Live" step. Clicking the html file then opening it in a browser is the substitute.
5. Download Node.js https://nodejs.org/en

Let's go!!!

1. Download the whole package through Code -> Download ZIP.
2. Unzip.
3. Find ".env". Fill the blank with your own OpenAI API KEY behind "=". (This file is going to be offline, so feel safe to do it!)
4. Open the terminal of your IDE. If you're a MacOS & VSCode user, press " ` + shift + control ".
5. Type "node server.js", then press enter (Windows) / return (MacOS).
6. Click "Go Live" at the buttom. (If you don't plan to use VSCode or Live Server, click the html file then open it in a browser)
